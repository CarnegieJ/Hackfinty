# Secure Civic Survey Platform with AI-Based Fraudulent Data Detection

## Domain
**Civic Services & Governance (Public Surveys & Data Verification)**  
This platform targets the challenges faced by citizens in semi-urban and rural areas in accessing governance services and ensures the integrity of public survey data.

---

## Problem Statement

Citizens in semi-urban and rural areas face challenges accessing governance services. Survey data used for civic rankings is often manipulated, leading to a trust deficit.

---

## Solution Overview

A web-based platform that collects public survey data and uses AI/ML to detect anomalies and fraudulent submissions in real time. It ensures transparency, accountability, and faster resolution of civic issues.

---

## Key Features

- **Real-time anomaly detection** using AI/ML
- **Secure authentication** and cloud-based data storage
- **Voice-first interaction** for low-literacy users
- **Multi-channel access** via mobile, WhatsApp, IVR, and SMS
- **Integration** with public datasets and sensor feeds
- **Automated complaint resolution** and feedback tracking

---

## Impact Metrics

- Complaint resolution time reduced by 60–80%
- Reduction in data manipulation cases
- Improved citizen satisfaction ratings
- Increased participation rate in civic feedback

---

## System Architecture

- **Frontend**: Responsive web interface and mobile app
- **Backend**: AI/ML engine for anomaly detection, cloud database for storage
- **Authentication**: Secure login mechanisms for users and officials
- **Data Sources**: Citizen reports, public datasets, sensor feeds, social media

---

## AI Components

- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies fraudulent or manipulated survey data
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Prioritizes complaints based on user frustration
- **Geo-Heatmaps**: Visualizes hotspots of unresolved issues
- **Voice Recognition**: Supports local languages and dialects
